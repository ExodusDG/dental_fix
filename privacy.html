                <li><u>Third Party suppliers.</u> We engage third parties, from time to time, to help us providing us
                    our Products and Services, including: <br>
                    - Business partners, suppliers (such as IT service providers) and sub-contractors; <br>
                    - Contact centres, to assist us on the Consumer Service-department; <br>
                    - Advertising and media companies that carry out marketing and media activities on our behalf
                    (including affiliate marketing); <br>
                    - Analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our
                    website and apps, such as Google Analytics. <br>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>In providing their services, these third party suppliers will access, receive, maintain or otherwise
                process Personal Data on our behalf. Our contracts with these service providers do not permit use of
                your Personal Data for their own (marketing) purposes. Consistent with applicable legal requirements, we
                take commercially reasonable steps to require such Third Party suppliers to adequately safeguard your
                Personal Data and only process it in accordance with our instructions.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><u>Corporate transaction.</u> In addition, Personal Data may be disclosed as part of any merger,
                    sale or transfer of Rituals’ assets.</li>
                <li><u>Third parties in case of legal requirement. </u>We may also disclose your Personal Data if we
                    believe we are required to do so by law.</li>
                <li><u>With consent.</u> We may also disclose information about you, including Personal Data to any
                    other third party, where you have consented or requested that we do so, for example in case of a
                    promotional campaign with another sponsor.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>6. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h2>
            <p>In most cases your Personal Data will be processed within the European Union. However, please be informed
                that Rituals may transfer and process any Personal Data you provide to us to countries other than your
                country of residence. The laws of these countries may not provide the same level of protection to your
                Personal Data. Rituals or Third Party suppliers we use will therefore seek to ensure that all adequate
                safeguards are in place and that all applicable laws and regulations are complied with in connection
                with such transfer, more in particular for Personal Data transferred to countries outside the European
                Economic Area. This means that we entered into legally necessary contracts with recipients of your data,
                including standard contractual clauses as approved by the European Commission or other supervisory
                authority where required.</p>
            <p>You are entitled to receive a copy of any documentation showing the suitable safeguards that have been
                taken by making a request via <a href="mailto:privacy@email.com">privacy@email.com</a>.</p>
            <h2>7. SECURITY</h2>
            <p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Data are properly secured using appropriate
                technical, physical, and organizational measures, so that they are protected against unauthorised or
                unlawful use, alteration, unauthorised access or disclosure, accidental or wrongful destruction, and
                loss.</p>
            <p>We take steps to limit access to your Personal Data to those persons who need to have access to it for
                one of the purposes listed in this Privacy Policy. Furthermore, we contractually ensure that any Third
                Party supplier processing your Personal Data equally provide for confidentiality and integrity of your
                data in a secure way.</p>

            <h2>8. DATA RETENTION</h2>
            <p>We retain your Personal Data for as long as required to satisfy the purpose for which they were collected
                and used (for example, for the time necessary for us to provide you with customer service, answer
                queries or resolve technical problems), unless a longer period is necessary for our legal obligations or
                to defend a legal claim.</p>

            <h2>9. YOUR RIGHTS</h2>
            <p>Subject to the conditions set forth in the applicable law, you have the following rights with regard to
                our processing of your Personal Data:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Right of access – You have the right to request confirmation if Rituals processes personal data

                <li>Right to rectification – You have the right to request that Rituals corrects, adjusts or completes

                    to ensure that changes in personal circumstances (for example, change of address, bank account,
                    etc.) are notified to Rituals so that we can ensure that your Personal Data is up-to-date. Rituals
                    will take all reasonable steps to ensure that all Personal Data are correct;</li>
                <li>Right to withdraw consent – You have the right to revoke your consent for receiving marketing

                    filling in the form as set out below. If we use your Personal Data based on your consent for other
                    reasons than marketing communication, you can revoke your consent by filling the form as set out
                    below;</li>
                <li>Right to delete - You have the right to request deletion of any irrelevant Personal Data we hold
                    about you when (i) the data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
                    collected; (ii) you withdraw your consent and there is no other legal ground for processing; (iii)
                    you object to the processing in case of direct marketing purposes, or – in any other case – there is
                    no overriding legitimate ground for processing; (iv) we unlawfully processed your data. If you have
                    such a request and all requirements are met, we shall make sure that Rituals erases the data of

                <li>Right to restriction of data use - You have the right to restrict our use of your Personal Data
                    where (i) you contest the accuracy of the Personal Data; (ii) the use is unlawful but you do not
                    want us to erase the data; (iii) we no longer need the Personal Data for the relevant purposes, but
                    you require them for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; or (iv) you have
                    objected to data use justified on our legitimate interests pending verification as to whether
                    Rituals has indeed compelling interests to continue the relevant data use;</li>
                <li>Right to data portability - to the extent that we use your Personal Data for the performance of an

                    machine-readable format, and also to require us to transmit it to another data controller where this
                    is technically feasible;</li>
                <li>Right to object - to the extent that we are relying on our legitimate interests to use your Personal
                    Data, you have the right to object to such use, and we must stop such processing unless we can
                    either demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the use that override your interests, rights
                    and freedoms or where we need to process the data for the establishment, exercise or defence of
                    legal claims. You also have the right to object to profiling activities conducted by Rituals;</li>
